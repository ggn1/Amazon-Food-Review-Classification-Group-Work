# Amazon Food Review Classification

This repository contains documents demonstrating code and other related content to a group project undertaken as part of Heriot-Watt University's Applied Text Analytics (F20AA) course under its BSc. Computer Science (Honours) program. The aim of the project was to build a classifier that predicts the score (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that will be given to a reviewed food item based on its text review.
